| Well-being app and Fitness Tracking Incentive 	| ACHIEVE intervention cost approx A$77432. Cost per participant recruited was A$944. Incremental Cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for MET increase per person per week was $0.61; minute of sedentary time reduced per participant per day was A$5.15 and BMI unit loss per participant was A$763. The long-term cost effectiveness analysis indicated that if the intervention was scaled-up to all eligible Australians, approximately 265,095 participants would be recruited to the program at an intervention cost of A$107.4 million. Health care cost savings were A$33.4 million. Total HALYs gained were 2,709. The mean ICER was estimated at A$27,297 per HALY gained which is considered cost-effective in the Australian setting. Intervention considered cost-effective if resulting in ICER below A$50,000 per HALY gained in Australian context (Maple et al., 2022). <br><br> Study to our knowledge to examine the cost-effectiveness of a commercial physical activity app (Carrot Rewards) over 5-year time horizon. Carrot Rewards had an ICER of $11,113 CAD per QALY, well below a $50,000 CAD per QALY willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold. Subgroup analyses revealed that the app had lower ICERs for British Columbians, females, highly engaged users, and adults aged 35-64 yrs., and was dominant for older adults (65 + yrs). Probabilistic sensitivity analyses revealed varying parameter estimates predominantly resulted in ICERs below the WTP threshold (Rondina, 2021). <br><br> Financial incentives for physical activity are more effective during the payment period when they are offered at a constant rate rather than an increasing or decreasing rate. Effectiveness dissipated shortly after the incentives were removed. Overall, for each $1 spent, participants in the constant incentives group logged 475.4 more steps than those in the increasing incentives group and 429.3 more steps than those in the decreasing incentives group (Chethan Bachireddy, 2019). |
| Smoking Cessation Program 	| The BSCI was cost-effective versus usual care with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £3145 per QALY (incremental costs: £165; incremental QALYs: 0.05). Integrated care was cost-effective versus SCC with an ICER of £6875 per QALY (incremental costs: £292; incremental QALYs: 0.04). The BSCI and IC were cost-effective in 89% and 83% of PSA iterations respectively. The main area of uncertainty related to relapse rates (Mattock et al., 2023). <br><br> ICERs for SCPs for cancer patients average around $4200 (median = $3400) and ICERs for SCPs as part of a cancer screening program average around $15,000 (median = $11,000). These are incredibly “good investments” (i.e., gains in patient outcomes for relatively low extra cost) compared to almost anything in the oncology portfolio, especially new treatments (Hotch et al., 2023). <br><br> Interest in cessation treatment among people who smoke in a community-based multidisciplinary Thoracic Oncology Program. Of 641 total respondents, the average age was 69 years (range: 32–95), 47% were men, 64% white, 34% black, and 17% college graduates. A total of 90% had ever smoked: 34% currently and 25% quit within the past year. Among the current smokers, 60% were very interested in quitting and 37% would participate in a cessation program. (Meadows Taylor, M. et al. 2021) <br><br> An observational online cross-sectional survey was conducted using a convenience sample of smokers and ex-smokers in Australia. A self-administered questionnaire was used to evaluate socio-demographic, psychological, smoking, and medication use characteristics. The Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence scale was used to assess the level of nicotine addiction. Logistic regression used to identify factors associated with smoking cessation. Of the 201 respondents, 33.3% had successfully quit smoking. (Mercha et al. 2023) |
| Hiking and Outdoor Activities Group 	| Davis (2017) Canada RCT , EQ-5D-3L patient: At 6 months:$1,800/QALY, At 12 months:$3,200/QALY, $20,000 (CAD) cost-effective threshold. The intervention consisted of an invitation, from a general practitioner, to participate in a 6-month walking-based, supervised exercise program with three 50-minute sessions per week. Of the patients invited to participate in the program, 79% were successfully recruited, and 86% of the participants in the exercise group completed the programme. Over 6 months, the mean treatment cost per patient in the exercise group was €41 more than "best care". The mean incremental QALY of intervention was 0.132 (95% CI: 0.104–0.286). Each extra QALY gained by the exercise programme relative to best care cost €311 (95% CI, €143–€394). The cost effectiveness acceptability curves showed a 90% probability that the addition of the walking programme is the best strategy if the ceiling of inversion is €350/QALY. <br><br> Literature demonstrates that simply being exposed to nature, even in passive ways, has clear benefits. For example, an early landmark study demonstrated that viewing nature through a hospital window decreased recovery time and pain medication requests, and increased general well-being of patients recovering from gallbladder surgery. (Mitten, D. et al. 2016) <br><br> Researchers have found the benefits of simply spending time in forests, or forest bathing, to include (a) decreased systolic blood pressure,42 (b) decreased stress levels (measured through prefrontal cortex activity and salivary cortisol),43 (c) deactivated sympathetic nervous system (measured via urinary adrenaline and noradrenaline levels),44 and (d) strengthened immune system (measured via enhanced natural killer cell activity and intercellular anticancer proteins).45-47 Each of these studies compared forest and urban environments, finding significant differences in health-related effects between the 2 environments throughout the study period.
