# Lumaria: Health Care Incentive Program for SuperLife
## 2024 SOA Student Research Case Study
Team GRP: Alexander Gerlyand, Mack Huang, Jayden Ly, Andre Wang, Robert Zheng

## Introduction

GRP has been tasked with improving Lumarian policyholder expected mortality for those who have purchased SuperLife’s whole life and term insurance products through being paired with incentive programs. Lumaria as a country is rich with cultural heritage whilst maintaining modernity. It offers a temperate climate, world renowned natural landmarks. Lumaria’s population has high literacy rates, an 18% smoking rate, and has access to universal healthcare. In this report, GRP aims to take advantage of Lumaria’s unique features in the form of a 3 intervention Health Incentive Program to achieve the objectives below.

## Objectives
The main objectives of the health incentive program are to:
- Incentivise healthy behaviours through participation in the program
- Decrease expected mortality
- Increase life insurance sales
- Improve product marketability and competitiveness
- Add economic value to SuperLife

The key metrics to measure the success of the program are profit, participation rate, impact on mortality (success rate) and surveys to see customer satisfaction. These metrics would be continuously monitored to ensure the Health Incentive Program is on track, and to inform SuperLife of how to adjust program parameters to ensure smooth operation into the future.

## Risk and Risk Mitigation Considerations
| Quantitative Risk                                               | Mitigation  |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Reinvestment risk related to investments into fixed income securities which are susceptible to interest rate fluctuations | Test the effects of adverse interest fluctuations on discounted profits. Hedge against decreasing long-term interest rates by buying interest rate options |
| Economic forecasts risk                                         | Future forecasted rates of inflation and interest rates do not reflect true movements in variables impacting accuracy of the model |
| Expense risk relating to maintenance of incentives programs      | Conducting cost-benefit analysis to evaluate effectiveness of different incentives programs, cost-plus process to ensure profits are maintained |
| Cost overrun risk where project costs deviate from actual experience | Establish contingency funds to address unexpected program costs and fluctuations in expenses. |
| Low participation rates in incentive programs - expected mortality and economics benefits will not be realised | Implement increased targeted market campaigns focusing on the distribution channels and educational initiatives to promote program awareness and encourage participation among policyholders. |
| Pandemic Risk: a pandemic may present an adverse change to the mortality of Lumarians | Sensitivity testing for extreme increases in mortality rate caused by pandemic |

| Qualitative Risk                                                   | Mitigation  |
|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Regulatory changes | Compliance monitoring to stay informed about regulatory changes and ensure compliance with laws and regulations.
| Negative Public Perception risk: If the program is perceived as exploiting users for their personal data or promoting unattainable body image standards.| Being transparent about privacy policies and data usage. Emphasis on the program being to promote healthier lifestyles rather than a focus on physical appearance. 
| Inequitable access risk: Socioeconomic factors may affect accessibility of programs to certain subsections of the population. | Implementing outreach programs and potential subsidies to make programs more accessible for everybody. Apps would have better UI and UX to accommodate for people who are less technologically literate.
