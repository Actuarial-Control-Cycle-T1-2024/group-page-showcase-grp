 Lumaria: Health Care Incentive Program for SuperLife
## 2024 SOA Student Research Case Study
Team GRP: Alexander Gerlyand, Mack Huang, Jayden Ly, Andre Wang, Robert Zheng

## Introduction

GRP has been tasked with improving Lumarian policyholder expected mortality for those who have purchased SuperLife’s whole life and term insurance products through being paired with incentive programs. Lumaria as a country is rich with cultural heritage whilst maintaining modernity. It offers a temperate climate, world renowned natural landmarks. Lumaria’s population has high literacy rates, an 18% smoking rate, and has access to universal healthcare. In this report, GRP aims to take advantage of Lumaria’s unique features in the form of a 3 intervention Health Incentive Program to achieve the objectives below.

### Objectives

The main objectives of the health incentive program are to:
- Incentivise healthy behaviours through participation in the program
- Decrease expected mortality
- Increase life insurance sales
- Improve product marketability and competitiveness
- Add economic value to SuperLife

The key metrics to measure the success of the program are profit, participation rate, impact on mortality (success rate) and surveys to see customer satisfaction. These metrics would be continuously monitored to ensure the Health Incentive Program is on track, and to inform SuperLife of how to adjust program parameters to ensure smooth operation into the future.

## Program Design

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) has shown that leading causes of death within SuperLife’s policyholders are cancer and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, the interventions chosen to make up the Health Incentive Program are targeted towards reducing the incidence of these conditions. These programs are:
1. Well-being app with fitness tracking incentives
2. Smoking cessation programs
3. Hiking group

### Well-being app with Fitness Tracking Incentives

The Well-being app with Fitness tracking incentives aims to provide a convenient platform for policyholders to monitor and enhance their physical and mental well-being. Through features such as personalised fitness goals, activity tracking and actionable insights, the app encourages active engagement. Policyholders are incentivised to utilise fitness trackers to monitor and improve their physical activity levels through achieving health-related milestones, with rewards including cash-back incentives, supermarket vouchers and lottery schedule rewards. The accessibility and convenience of mobile apps for fitness tracking promote higher participation rates and increase in policyholders. Weekly motivational messages and notifications further encourage sustained engagement and goal achievement. By focussing on decreasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality rates while improving overall health outcomes, the program offers tangible benefits to both individuals and insurers, fostering a mutually beneficial relationship built on promoting healthier lifestyle choices.

### Smoking Cessation Program

The Smoking Cessation program offers a comprehensive platform for policyholders seeking to quit smoking, providing crucial resources and support tailored for individual needs. This program addresses the significant health concerns of cancer and cardiovascular disease among policyholders as well as the general population. EDA showed a significant difference in mortality upon smoking, making this an invaluable tool to improve the overall health of policyholders. Despite the smoking rate among the policyholders being a lower 6.31%, the projected increase in policyholders per year will attract those from the general population where a greater 18% are smokers. In addition to the health benefits such as reduction in risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer, the incentive for policyholders will also potentially reduce their long-term healthcare costs and improve their quality of life. The program also offers additional incentives to encourage participation such as access to support groups and discounts on health insurance premiums for non-smokers.

### Hiking and Outdoor Activities Group

The Hiking and Outdoor Activities Group offers a platform for policyholders to engage in physical activities amidst Lumaria’s Luminous Lake, Skyreach and Whispering Woods. This program’s main objective is to improve policyholders' all round health with particular focus on cardiovascular and mental health. Studies have shown that simply the act of being in nature has clear health benefits of reduced stress and improved recovery times. Combining this with group physical activity creates a platform for policyholders to connect, forge new relationships, whilst increasing the level of incidental exercise to improve cardiovascular health. Furthermore, sightseeing and socialising aspects of these activities make policyholders likely to persist in the program over time, reducing mortality. SuperLife can also leverage Lumarian public holidays such as Super Luminova to organise larger events and competitions to reward policyholder participation. Participation in these groups can be recorded in the aforementioned Well-being app to claim rewards.

Applications of these interventions in other countries have shown to be cost-effective and in reducing the expected mortality while encouraging participation in the program due to the accessibility.

## Risk and Risk Mitigation Considerations

| Qualitative Risk                                                   | Mitigation  |
|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Reinvestment risk related to investments into fixed income securities which are susceptible to interest rate fluctuations 	| Test the effects of adverse interest fluctuations on discounted profits. Hedge against decreasing long-term interest rates by buying interest rate options
| Economic forecasts risk 	| Future forecasted rates of inflation and interest rates do not reflect true movements in variables impacting accuracy of the model
| Expense risk relating to maintenance of incentives programs 	| Conducting cost-benefit analysis to evaluate effectiveness of different incentives programs, cost-plus process to ensure profits are maintained
| Cost overrun risk where project costs deviate from actual experience 	| Establish contingency funds to address unexpected program costs and fluctuations in expenses.
| Low participation rates in incentive programs - expected mortality and economics benefits will not be realised 	| Implement increased targeted market campaigns focusing on the distribution channels and educational initiatives to promote program awareness and encourage participation among policyholders.
| Pandemic Risk: a pandemic may present an adverse change to the mortality of Lumarians 	| Sensitivity testing for extreme increases in mortality rate caused by pandemic

| Qualitative Risk                                                   | Mitigation  |
|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Regulatory changes | Compliance monitoring to stay informed about regulatory changes and ensure compliance with laws and regulations.
| Negative Public Perception risk: If the program is perceived as exploiting users for their personal data or promoting unattainable body image standards.| Being transparent about privacy policies and data usage. Emphasis on the program being to promote healthier lifestyles rather than a focus on physical appearance. 
| Inequitable access risk: Socioeconomic factors may affect accessibility of programs to certain subsections of the population. | Implementing outreach programs and potential subsidies to make programs more accessible for everybody. Apps would have better UI and UX to accommodate for people who are less technologically literate.
